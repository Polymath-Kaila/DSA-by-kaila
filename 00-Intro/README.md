# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

## Purpose of this Repository
This repository documents my **structured journey through Data Structures and Algorithms**.  

### The goals are:  
- To deeply understand DSA concepts from **first principles** 
- To write **clear explanations**, not just code
- To build long-term reference notes for **myself and other devs**
- To connect **theory - intuition - implementation**
- To solve **Leetcode challenges and confidently attend interviews**

This is not just about passing interviews - it is about **thinking like a computer scientist**

## How this repository is organized

Each folder represents a **core DSA concept**, studied in this order:  

1. Foundations (Intro, Big O)
2. Linear Data Structures (Lists, Stacks, Queues)
3. Non-Linear Data Structures (Trees, Graphs)
4. Algorithms (Searching, Sorting, Recursion, Traversal)
5. Performance & Trade-offs

Each section contains:  
- Concept explanations
- Diagrams & visualizations
- Mathematical intuition
- Code examples (where applicable)
- Edge cases & common pitfalls

## Learning Philosophy

I follow this loop for every topic:  

>**What is it → Why does it exist → How does it work → How fast is it → When should I use it**

No memorization.  
Only understanding

### Several leetcode challenges and interview question are in this repo and i have tried to solve as many as i can please follow through
